Use a trained models to filter satelite images based on cloudiness and download them.  

Prerequisites include docker, docker-compose and ColonyOS.
To understand each individual part better please check those repos out.

Utilizing ColonyOS to process large amounts of satelite data for various use cases, e.g. dataset creation.
ColonyOS offers a degrees of robustness and guarantees

Some future work to make this a more powerful and useful tool is to
